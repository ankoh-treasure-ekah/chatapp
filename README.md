# chatapp
Created a messaging and file transfer cli application with python sockets. Code is a little crazy and could need a little refactoring.
The whole project basically contains a server file and a client file which connects to the server and starts sending messages which the server broadcasts to all available client(in case you run the client code multiple times).
sending a file requires the user simply typing a file as the message and the server will ask yo input a file name which has to be stored in the same folder as the client.
The file is the sent and broadcasted from the server to all clients.
work on refactoring the code but accept all contributions.
Thank you
